There are two kind of constants in Go.

Typed:

```go
const a string = "santosh"
const i := 42
```

Now what will happen if we add 1.2 to i? Because datatype is not defined. 

Untyped:

```go
x := 42
y := x + 19
```

The type is determined on the time of compilations.

That's how there are typed and untyped constants in Go programming language.
